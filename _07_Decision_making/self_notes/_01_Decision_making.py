#DECISION MAKING

'''
There comes situations in real life when we need to do some specific task and based
on some specific conditions and, we decide what should we do next. Similarly there
comes a situation in programming where a specific task is to be performed if a specific
condition is True. In such cases, conditional statements can be used. The following are
the conditional statements provided by Python.
if
if..else
Nested if
if-elif statements
'''

'''Python programming language assumes any
non-zero and not-Nonevalues as True, and if it is either
zero or None, then it is assumed as False value.'''

a=20
b =20
if a<=b:
    print('b is big')
elif a==b:
    print('both are equal')
else:
    print('a is small')

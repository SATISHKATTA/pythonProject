"""
Encapsulation is the packing of data and functions that work on that data within a 
single object. By doing so, you can hide the internal
state of the object from the outside. This is known as information hiding.

A class is an example of encapsulation. A class bundles data and methods into a single unit.
 And a class provides the access to its attributes via methods.

The idea of information hiding is that if you have an attribute that isn’t visible to the outside, 
you can control the access to its value to make sure your object is always has a valid state.

Calling protected member of base class: 

Private members
Private members are similar to protected members, the difference is that the class members declared private should neither be accessed outside the class nor by any base class. In Python, there is no existence of Private instance variables that cannot be accessed except inside a class. However, to define a private member prefix the member name with double underscore “__”.
 

Note: Python’s private and protected member can be accessed outside the class through python name mangling.

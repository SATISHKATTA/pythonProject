#Comparison Operators:
"""Comparison of Relational operators compares the values. It either returns True or
False according to the condition."""
"""> Greater than: True if the left operand is greater than the right x > y
< Less than: True if the left operand is less than the right x < y
== Equal to: True if both operands are equal x == y
!= Not equal to – True if operands are not equal x != y
>= Greater than or equal to True if the left operand is greater than
or equal to the right
x >= y
<= Less than or equal to True if the left operand is less than or
equal to the right
x <= y"""
